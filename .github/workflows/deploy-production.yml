# GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment to production server
# This workflow builds the React/Vite project and deploys it via FTP
name: Deploy to Production

# Trigger: This workflow runs when code is pushed to the 'production' branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - production

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    # Use the latest Ubuntu runner for better performance and compatibility
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    # Step 1: Download the source code from the repository
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Step 2: Install Bun (JavaScript runtime and package manager)
    # Bun is used because the project has bun.lockb file
    - name: Setup Bun
      uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      with:
        bun-version: latest

    # Step 3: Install all project dependencies
    # This will read package.json and install all required packages
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: bun install

    # Step 4: Build the production-ready application
    # Vite will create optimized files in the dist/ folder
    - name: Build project
      run: bun run build

    # Step 5: Deploy the built files to the FTP server
    # This uploads everything from dist/ to the production server
