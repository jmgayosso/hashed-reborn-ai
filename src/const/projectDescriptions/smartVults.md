# Smart Vaults: Redefining Bitcoin Wallet Management

We believe Bitcoin is the best monetary technology—but trusting others is inherently risky.  
Remember how we thought Sam from FTX was a good actor? Alternatively, trusting yourself to securely hold keys comes with its own set of challenges.

We identified an opportunity to build a self-custody solution that leverages:

- The programmability of Taproot Miniscript, enabling features like time-based recovery paths and decaying signatures
- Nostr for identity, communication, and payment coordination

This vision led to the creation of **Smart Vaults**, which secured seed funding from [Wolf](https://wolfnyc.com/).

## Key Features

### Secure Collaboration  
Smart Vaults uses Nostr relays to securely share transaction details among participants, enabling privacy-preserving collaboration.

### Minimal Infrastructure  
The solution only requires a Bitcoin node and a Nostr relay. This simplicity facilitates self-hosting and lowers the entry barrier for both users and developers.

### Hardware Wallet Support  
Smart Vaults currently supports Coldcard wallets via Edge firmware and Ledger devices. Support will expand as more hardware wallets adopt Miniscript within Taproot descriptors.

## Vault Templates

Smart Vaults introduces customizable vault templates that offer flexible and robust asset management strategies:

- **Decaying Multisig**  
  Enables a reduction in the number of required signers over time, providing a safeguard against key loss and improving decision-making flexibility.

- **Collaborative Custody**  
  Supports multiple co-signer configurations for shared management of funds.

- **Social Recovery and Inheritance**  
  Facilitates recovery through trusted co-signers defined by the user, mitigating the risk of permanent asset loss.

## Taproot Integration

Smart Vaults fully incorporates Taproot, Bitcoin’s most recent protocol upgrade, to deliver the following benefits:

- **Enhanced Privacy**  
  Complex transactions are masked as standard ones, improving user confidentiality on the blockchain.

- **Reduced Costs**  
  More efficient transaction construction can lower network fees.

- **Greater Flexibility**  
  Taproot enables advanced spending conditions without revealing sensitive transaction logic.

## Decentralized by Design

By relying on Nostr relays, Smart Vaults operates without centralized dependencies. This design:

- Aligns with Bitcoin’s decentralized philosophy  
- Improves user privacy and autonomy  
- Increases platform resilience and censorship resistance

## Backed by Wolf’s Accelerator Program

Smart Vaults was selected to join Wolf’s accelerator program—an initiative focused on transforming early-stage ideas into market-ready ventures. This competitive eight-week program supports the development of high-potential projects in the decentralized finance space.

Participation in the program underscores Smart Vaults' commitment to innovation, scalability, and long-term viability within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

## Conclusion

Smart Vaults elevates Bitcoin wallet management by introducing a new paradigm for flexibility, security, and self-custody.

By combining Miniscript programmability, Taproot enhancements, and a decentralized communications layer via Nostr, Smart Vaults empowers users with greater control over their digital assets.

It represents not just an evolution in wallet design, but a fundamental step forward in building a more resilient, private, and user-centric Bitcoin infrastructure.
