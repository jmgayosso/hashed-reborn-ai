# Modernizing Due Diligence Reporting for Snyder Kearney

## Overview

**Snyder Kearney**, a leading provider of multi-disciplinary due diligence, traditionally delivered in-depth analyses of target securities offerings via static PDF reports. While comprehensive, this format limited user engagement and made it difficult to navigate and analyze data effectively—hindering the ability to extract deeper insights.

Recognizing the need for modernization, Snyder Kearney sought to upgrade their reporting processes with a more dynamic, interactive solution.

- Ensuring **data integrity and consistency**, eliminating the need for manual intervention
