# Case Study: Leveraging Machine Learning to Strengthen Competitive Position in Banking

## Introduction

Most projects begin with a straightforward client request. In this case, a top global bank approached us to explore the application of **Machine Learning** within its operations in **Mexico**. From the outset, we adopted an open-minded and exploratory approach, eager to uncover the complexities of their systems and strategic challenges.

## Context and Challenge

Our initial conversations with executives in the **cooperative banking division**—which manages funds for major multinational corporations like **Samsung**, **Apple**, and **Corona**—revealed a pressing concern: despite being a leading bank in the region, they were losing ground to more agile competitors.

Smaller banks were attracting clients with **short-term return advantages**, especially near end-of-month financial reporting periods. These brief gains were enough to disrupt long-standing relationships, as competitors used them to claim:  
> “Our bank manages the funds of the largest corporations in the country.”

Compounding the issue was the **lack of granular visibility into fund transfers**, especially those between companies and their subsidiaries. While the destination of the funds was known, the nature of the transfers remained unclear—were they **routine payments** or **strategic reallocation** motivated by yield optimization?

Moreover, the bank faced significant **data quality issues**, making even the identification of transaction beneficiaries a challenge.

## Our Approach

To address these issues, we implemented a **multi-layered analytical strategy**:

- Applied **fuzzy matching** techniques to improve beneficiary identification  
- Distinguished **internal inter-company transfers** from **external third-party payments**  
- Investigated whether counterparties were **existing customers**  
- Identified **transaction behavior patterns** to assess client loyalty and strategic intent  

This enabled us to classify transactions into actionable categories:

- **Worrisome**: Transactions requiring immediate client outreach and defensive engagement  
- **Benign/Internal**: Transfers offering **cross-sell opportunities**, such as consolidating financial services within the bank  

## Outcome

The project concluded with measurable impact:

- Strengthened the bank’s ability to respond strategically to client behavior  
- Revealed hidden opportunities for customer retention and upselling  
- Enhanced internal visibility into fund flow dynamics  
- Positioned the bank more competitively in a rapidly evolving market  

## Conclusion

This initiative exemplifies how **data science and machine learning**, when applied thoughtfully, can deliver strategic clarity in complex financial ecosystems. By turning ambiguity into actionable insight, we empowered our client to reclaim ground in a highly competitive space.
